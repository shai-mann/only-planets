# OnlyPlan(et)s

OnlyPlans is only for planets. Don't use this if you're a human!

## But Really, what is it?

It's a project to teach freshman NEU CS students how to program full-stack applications. It teaches the basics of Python, React, JS/HTML/CSS, REST APIs, and basic external API usage.

The project itself consists of voting "yes" or "no" on random planet images, and viewing past votes.

## Starting the project:

To start the server, run the following:

```
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

Installing the requirements and running `cd server` is not necessary every time, but you must make sure the requirements are installed, and the `python3` command is being run from within the right folder.
