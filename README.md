OnlyPlans is only for planets. Don't use this if you're a human!

## But Really, what is it?

It's a project to teach freshman NEU CS students how to program full-stack applications. It teaches the basics of Python, React, JS/HTML/CSS, REST APIs, and basic external API usage.

The project itself consists of voting "yes" or "no" on random planet images, and viewing past votes.
